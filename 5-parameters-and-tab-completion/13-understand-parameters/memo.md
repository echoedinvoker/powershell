- A parameter is something that is used to narrow the scope of the search results.
- There are two types of PowerShell parameters: require and optional.
- Here is an explanation of each parameter according to the numbers indicated in the diagram above:

  1. require parameter, because it has two double quotes and must be followed by a string.
     - Although this parameter is required, it can be left out because it is **invisible**.
       - **invisible** means that PowerShell will automatically enter it for you.
  2. **single** optional parameter, Because the parameter is followed by a string, but only one brackets is seen.
     - optional means that this command can be used without this parameter.
     - **single** means that this parameter does not need to be followed by any value.
     - If this parameter want to be **required**, it must be wrapped in another layer of brackets, but usually **single has no need to be require**.
  3. optional parameter
  4. optional parameter
  5. **require parameter**, This parameter has only one brackets, but it needs to be followed by a string, so it is also require parameter.
     - It is easy to be confused with 1 and 3, the point is that **string not be wrapped**.
     - The difference with 1 is that you will just be **promted for the string**, meaning you do not have to type it in.
  6. require parameter
  7. optional parameter
  8. optional parameter
  9. optional parameter
  10. optional parameter
