- It's basically the same as **JS forEach**, except for a slight syntax change (**no callback function**).
- The point of foreach command here in PowerShell is to know which command will get the **dataset** (usually the Get- command).

- Another major difference from JS forEach is that:
  - A **forEach loop in JS** is usually used to run a simple dataset (usually **array** only).
  - The **foreach in PowerShell** runs a dataset where the members are almost always **objects with many properties, methods**...
