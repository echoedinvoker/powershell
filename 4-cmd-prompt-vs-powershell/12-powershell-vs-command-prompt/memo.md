- From the above, we can see that there is no uniformity in the commands in command prompt.
  - This causes us to learn each command individually.

- **Module** means a **collection of commands or settings** about a particular topic.
  - So we select the module at the top of the side bar, and the commands about this topic will appear at the bottom.
- PowerShell command must be in the form of **Verb. + Noun**.
  - Because the syntax is so unified, the average user can quickly get familiar with it.
