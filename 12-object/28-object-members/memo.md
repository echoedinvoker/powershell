## **Concept**

- Under each object there will be members, members have three types:
  - property
    - attribute of object.
  - method
    - let object to action something.
  - event
    - wait something happened and trigger some action.

## **Practice**

- In fact, get-service generates an **object** "service" and prints it directly in the console.

- Because the result of get-service is an **object**, we can **pipe get-member** to get the **member** list of this object.

- The result you see above is also the **object** generated by the get-member, so of course you can also **pipe another get-member** to print out the **member** list of the second object.
