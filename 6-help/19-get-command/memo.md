- Although the real part of the command execution is in the blue area below, it is better to get used to writing in the script window above even for in-line commands, because of the **colored coding** command and **better intellisense presentation**.
- The **get-command** will only return commands and very little other information, but often our goal is just to find that right command.

## **Open New Script Window**
